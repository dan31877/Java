ReadMe.txt

This project consists of two source files, ShoppingItem.py and ShoppingListGenerator.py, along with a pricing list for items. The main method is located in source file ShoppingListGenerator.py along with a call to run the main method so running ShoppingListGenerator.py 
will run the entire program.

In more detail, this project runs from a file called ShoppingListGenerator.py which uses a class called ShoppingItem from file ShoppingItem.py. It begins by importing a text file shopping_price_list.txt that contains a list of all potential items to choose from. This file is saved as a list of dictionaries in the program. The program prompts the user to enter an item to be searched in the list or to exit the program by typing 'exit'. If the user enters an item that it not on the list, the user is prompted again. Once the user enters an item that matches one or more of the items on the shopping_price_list, the user is given a list of all the potential matching items and asked to choose or enter '0' to return to the search prompt. Only valid entries are accepted and the user is then prompted to return to the list of matching items if the size of the list is greater than one (there is no need to go back to the matching list if there is only one item on it). The user is prompted again to search for more items until the user decides to exit. When the program exits, the shopping is displayed if it's not empty and the user is asked if the shopping list file should be saved. If the user chooses to save, the shopping list is exported to a file that is date-stamped.
