Book Shopping Cart & Filter Application (Angular)

NOTE: The “node_module” folder will not be included due to it's size. You can just use “npm install” to get all the package dependencies or just view the code files.

Part1 –   Angular Shopping Cart Application
Using Angular, modify the Shopping Cart application covered in the lecture as follows. 
The changes to the sample application are as follows: 
• The total value of the ordered books is now displayed on the table header row last column. This value should change whenever the inputs affecting the total change. 
• The title, quantity, and unit price are editable inputs. Changing the quantity or the unit price should be reflected in the line total and the order total. 
• The Remove button removes the respective book from the model. The view is automatically updated. 
• The New button will add a new book object to the model. The default title will be “New Book” with quantity 1 and unit price of 10.99. Clicking on this button will insert one new book each time it is clicked. 


Part2 –   Angular Filters
Using Angular, write the filter tokenize that can take an optional argument for the delimiter. By default, the filter produces a 
comma separated string of the individual characters of the given input. If the delimiter is provided, the individual characters in 
the input string are separated by the specified delimiter.
