PagingGUI.README

This program was built for an Operating Systems class. The program replicates a paging table with a TLB and searches for a memory address first 
in the TLB and then in the paging table. If the address is found, it's recorded as a hit and if not it's a miss.
I worked in a group of three and my contribution was the GUI.
