Cache Project - run from Main.cpp

This project is an implementation of a software simulation of a cache memory subsystem. Note that any real cache is 
invisible to software.  This will be a simulation of the way that a real cache works.  
This "cache" will be a software structure/class  that will contain information similar (but on a smaller and more 
simplified scale) to what would be in a real cache.  The "main memory" will be a 2K array.  It can be an 
array of integers or shorts (16-bits), but because it is simulating a byte-addressable memory, you won't be putting 
any value larger than 0xFF (255 decimal or 11111111 binary) in it.
