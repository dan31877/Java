Pipeline Project - can be run from Main.cpp

This program will have four pipeline registers, which are set up as structures (or something equivalent to 
structures in your language of choice) with a READ and a WRITE version for each.  Each pipeline register's structure 
will be different and will be based on the information being passed from the previous stage (just like in the 
real world).
