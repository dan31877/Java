DataStructures_LinkedList

This program is separated into two parts. 

Part 1: IntNode.java and IntLinkedList.java implement a simple Linked List using type ints in the node.
This part is run through IntLinkedList.java.

Part 2: GenericNode.java and StringLinkedList.java implement a Linked List using generic types in the node which can implement a 
Linked List of any type. This part is run through StringLinkedList.java using a String type.
