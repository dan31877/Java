SpeakAndSpell_README

This program was developed for my CS232 (Intro to Java) class as a final project. It's a speak and spell so the user can 
type a word and the computer will read it back. I also added speaking flashcards for math at various levels. This program requires 
special installation described in the SoundSetup_README and can be run from the MainMenu class.
