Web Applications FINAL Project

The final project of my web applications class was to design a website. I chose to design a website for the 
parent council of my daughter's school. The website was comprised of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP files. 
The website also connected to a MySQL database and used Ajax/JQuery to validate a form that made calls to 
this database. This repository contains only the files for this project, the site and database have since 
been taken down.
