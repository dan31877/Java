DataStructures_HashTables

This program uses Open Address Hashing and Chained Hashing, to store the entries of a movie database. 
It will read in the data for any of these records, and then store it in an Open Address Hashed array 
and a Chained Hash array. Use HashDriver.java to launch the program.
